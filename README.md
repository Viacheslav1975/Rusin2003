Microsoft Access DB for work small company for 5-10 people I created this base to work in a paint company in 2000 year. The base functioned perfectly for more than 10 years. The database works fine in MS Office 32 bit. Form Redox not working in MS Office 64 bit. I am attaching an html file that describes the problem. I have done many tests with different Microsoft Windows systems (XP, 7, 8, 8.1 and 10) and Microsoft Offices 2007(x86), 2010/2013/2016 (x86 and x64), 2019(x64). In all other respects, the data base works fine.
